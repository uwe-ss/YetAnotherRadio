# Yet Another Radio
> Heavily inspired by [Advanced Radio Player Applet](https://store.kde.org/p/2136933/)

A GNOME Shell extension for listening to internet radio stations directly from your panel.

This extension uses [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/)'s API to fetch radio urls and play them using gstreamer (Usually being installed with GNOME).
